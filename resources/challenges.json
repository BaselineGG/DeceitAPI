Usual protocol is that I look after all the hatchlings but I see that one has grown attached to you, so you should keep him. I don't suppose you could do me a favour? I need to catch up on collecting all the easter eggs before they go.",
        "163": "Hmm, there's no way we're going to be able to hatch all these eggs in time. We need some way of speeding up the process, got any ideas?",
        "164": "Thank you so much! You've helped save Easter but there's one last thing. I need you to unblock the entrance at the Asylum to the rabbit hole so me and the chicks can go back home. In return for your help I can give you the imposter outfit which I took when you rescued me.",

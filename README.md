# Deceit API
This repository contains documentation for the public Deceit API, for use by community developers on the game [Deceit](https://playdeceit.com/).
It is maintained by the Baseline Games team, which runs and operates Deceit.

## Disclaimer
We make our best effort to keep this repository up to date, but do not provide any guarantees that the information here is accurate.

The resources provided here are also updated at best effort, but sometimes may be outdated or may contain mismatched information to the live game.

We also make no guarantees to the availability or stability of the API.

**Please note these experimental APIs have no guarantee of availability, may be subject to rate limiting and may change at any time. We are looking at a large rework of our backend systems and this will likely bring a full documented fully-featured API in the future.**

Currently the API is limited to 10,000 calls a day per IP.
